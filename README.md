# DataAnalyticsCA
Repo for 3nd year Data Analytics class assignment, written in Python using Google Colab

This assignment focuses on analysing and representing statistics from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, which details how threatened different species of animals are, from Least Concern (LC) all the way to species which are Critically Endangered (CR) or even Extinct (EX)

I intend to analyse the data provided by IUCN as well as data from the World Health Organisation and worldbank.org which detail levels of pollution and forest cover by country, in order to try to discover where animals are most threatened and what parts of the world require the most urgent conservation.

The data sets I have used will be listed and their sources cited below.
